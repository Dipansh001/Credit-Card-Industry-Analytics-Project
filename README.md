# Credit-Card-Industry-Analytics-Project**
This project leverages data analytics to gain insights into customer behavior and enhance decision-making in the credit card industry. Key tasks include data preprocessing, customer spend and repayment behavior analysis, fraud detection, and predictive modeling. Using Python, various summaries and visualizations are created to answer business-critical questions and support strategic decisions.

### Key Features:
1. **Data Preprocessing**: 
   - Impute ages less than 18 with the mean age.
   - Adjust spend amounts exceeding the limit to 50% of the customer’s limit.
   - Cap repayment amounts to the customer’s limit.

2. **Data Analysis and Summarization**:
   - Identify distinct customers and categories.
   - Calculate average monthly spend and repayment.
   - Compute monthly bank profits considering a 2.9% interest rate.
   - Determine top product types, top-spending cities, top age groups, and top repaying customers.

3. **Visualization**:
   - City-wise yearly spend on each product.
   - Monthly and yearly comparisons of total spends and specific product spends.
   - Seasonal spending trends.

4. **Custom Analysis Function**:
   - Python function to find the top 10 customers by repayment amount for each city, product type, and time period (monthly/yearly).

This project provides comprehensive insights into customer behaviors, enabling improved marketing strategies, fraud detection, and overall business performance in the credit card industry.
